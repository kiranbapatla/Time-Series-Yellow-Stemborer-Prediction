# Yellow Stemborer (YSB) Prediction in Indian sub-tropical climate
YSB is the major  insect pest of the Rice causing significant economic losses. Statistical models relay on assumptions, where most of the insect pest data do not follow these assumptions. While machine learning models are data driven. Therefore, data driven models are show more accuracy over the statistical models. Multi-Layer Perception (MLP) Model and Long-Short Trem Memory (LSTM) Model were developed and compared for their accuracy. These models predict the one step ahead (one week ahead) BPH population from previous recoded BPH population and weather paramerts (weekly mean surface air temperature, weekly mean Relative humidity,weekly total rainfall/precepitation)

## How to run the code

### MLP and LSTM model
Run the notebook file "MLP.ipynb" and "LSTM.ipynb" by importing data file name "MLP_LSTM_data.csv"
